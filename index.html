            As a non-governmental Organization, it is our obligation to bring to the fore front of our
            discussions on one of the most pressing issues affecting our dear planet in recent years. According to the
            2022 UN report there was much greater evidence of increasing human influence on climate change,
              largely
              due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

              global temperatures, with particular acceleration in the last two decades; changes in precipitation
              patterns; an increase in the intensity of cyclone activity; rising sea levels; and a decline in Northern
              Hemisphere snow cover, as well as in the size and mass of glaciers.</quote>, from critical analysis and
            scientific projects, the global warming will increase from 1.8 centigrade as of the time of this report to 4
            degrees centigrade. However, we are all aware of this recent development around every part of this planets
            some of which are visible to the naked eyes, from Heat waves, draughts, rise in ocean level and drastic
            change
            in our eco system. As an Ngo, we are advocating for ways to prevent this natural occurences caused by human
            action.

      <p class="lead">
        Healthy ecosystems are at the heart of development, underpinning societal well-being and economic growth.
        Through
        nature-based solutions, such as the sustainable management and protection of land, rivers and oceans, we help
        ensure
        that countries have adequate food and water, are resilient to climate change and disasters, shift to green
        economic
        pathways, and can sustain work for billions of people through forestry, agriculture, fisheries and tourism.

      <p class="lead">A long-standing partner of the Global Environment Facility, and now with the second-largest Green
        Climate Fund
        portfolio, UNDP is the primary actor on climate change in the United Nations. Our aim is to help build the Paris
        Agreement and all environmental agreements into the heart of countries’ development priorities. After all, the
        food,
        shelter, clean air, education and opportunities of billions of people depend on getting this right.

        people
